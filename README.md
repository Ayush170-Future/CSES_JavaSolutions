# CSES_JavaSolutions
This is java solutions of Cses problem set.
Pro tip: As cses is pretty hard(impossible) to solve with java you always need to 100% optimize your solution to get accepted, you should take care of input(use buffer reader), use good algo and a good output(use StringBuilder or buffer instead of string, and try to keep the no. of println statements min).
Even majority of my programs are also not accepting but then also i am adding those so that atleast we understand the logic.
BTW, now some of cses problems are availeble in codeforces gym also: https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/87912#:~:text=Slow%20CSES%20Judge,faster%2C%20which%20solves%20this%20issue.
