# CSES Java Solutions
These are Java solutions to the Cses problem set. Here's a pro tip: Since Cses problems can be quite challenging (even impossible) to solve with Java, it's essential to optimize your solutions to ensure they are accepted. You should pay attention to the input (use BufferedReader), employ efficient algorithms, and utilize appropriate output methods (such as StringBuilder or BufferedWriter) instead of regular strings. Additionally, try to minimize the number of println statements.

Another helpful technique is to use String Tokenizer along with PrintWriter, as it can speed up your code. Even though some of my programs may not be accepted, I include them to aid in understanding the logic.

By the way, some Cses problems are now available on Codeforces Gym as well. You can find them here: https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/87912#:~:text=Slow%20CSES%20Judge,faster%2C%20which%20solves%20this%20issue
